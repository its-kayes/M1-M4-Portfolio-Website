            <p class="about">Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to
                introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me
                give a
                try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression
                about
                myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>
